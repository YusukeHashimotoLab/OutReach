# OutReach Website Analysis Report
Date: 2025-07-26

## Executive Summary
The OutReach website has been successfully restructured with language-specific folders (jp/ and en/), a unified CSS design system, and new pages for News, Talks, and Research DX. However, several issues need to be addressed before the website is ready for public viewing.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Navigation Inconsistencies
- **CRITICAL**: Japanese pages are missing "News" link in navigation
- Several pages missing `aria-current="page"` attribute for active nav items
- Navigation order differs between JP and EN versions

### 2. Missing Assets
- **CRITICAL**: Root-level `/images/` directory is missing
- Member photos referenced in multiple pages but only exist in `/nanomaterial/images/`
- Incorrect image paths in nanomaterial member pages (alt text and src don't match)

### 3. Language Version Discrepancies
- Japanese index.html is 118 lines longer than English version
- News page: JP version has 69 more lines than EN version
- Content structure differences need review
